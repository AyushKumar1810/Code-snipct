### My Motivation
In an era where code is poetry and creativity knows no bounds, I wanted to merge these worlds into something visually appealing and practical. Inspired by the growing trend of sharing snippets, I created Code-snipct to provide a platform where developers can transform their code into dynamic gifs and images. This tool is not just a utility but a canvas, offering endless customization and feature expansion possibilities. It's my way of adding a personal touch to the coding community, making sharing code snippets as engaging and beautiful as possible. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ûïüåë




### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [DOM to Image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image)
* [GIFshot](https://yahoo.github.io/gifshot/)
